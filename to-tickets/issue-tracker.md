# Issue tracker: local Markdown

- Specs: `.agents/tickets/<feature>/spec.md`.
- Tickets: `.agents/tickets/<feature>/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, one per file.
- Create directories on demand. Follow the project's existing policy on tracking ticket files in Git. If it has no policy, prefer tracking them so scope, dependencies, decisions, and completion evidence can be shared; do not change ignore rules or stage files without authorization. Do not publish tickets to external issue trackers without permission.
- Fetch a ticket by reading the supplied path, its spec if linked, dependencies, and notes. If only a number is supplied and it is ambiguous, ask for the feature or path.
- Use a `Status:` line: `draft` (unapproved), `ready` (approved), `in-progress`, `blocked`, or `done`. Explain blockers in `## Notes`.
- `Blocked by:` lists sibling ticket filenames or `none`. A ticket is eligible when it is `ready` and all dependencies are `done`. Detect missing or circular dependencies rather than guessing.
- Keep decisions in the spec, or in the ticket if no spec exists. Keep progress, review findings, and verification commands with outcomes in the ticket. Preserve existing notes when updating files.
- Mark a ticket `done` only when acceptance criteria are met, review is complete, and required checks pass. Record unresolved nonblocking findings explicitly. Completion does not require a commit unless the user requested one.
- When instructed to publish a spec or ticket, write these local files, not a GitHub issue. No tracker CLI, triage labels, glossary, or additional setup is needed.
